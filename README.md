I am Sakhawat Hossain.
I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
If I could eat one type of cuisine for the rest of my life, it would be italian food as I enjoy pizza and pasta.
I don't have any Data science experience. I took Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses last semester at UConn. In those courses, I was introduced to few Machine Learning and AI algorithms.
